# Sheet

Sheet is a clean, responsive theme for Ghost 0.4+ blogs. You can view a demo (with a few minor modifications) [right here](http://bokstuff.com/blog).

`.sheet-header-secondary` and `.sheet-footer-secondary` are empty elements that you can use to add custom content to your header and footer, respectively. Cover images are used for the fixed background in the header, and blog/user images are supported.

Sheet uses [Pure](https://github.com/yui/pure/) for its responsive grid. It uses [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) from Google Fonts, and includes [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) as well as [jQuery](http://jquery.com).
